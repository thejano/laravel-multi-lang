# Why Laravel Multi-Lang?

Laravel Multi-Lang provides a cohesive, production-ready platform for managing polymorphic translations inside your Laravel applications. It wraps the heavy lifting—schema, traits, helpers, caching, tooling—into one familiar package so your team can stay focused on features rather than plumbing.

## What you get

- **Developer-friendly API** – expressive trait methods, helpers, and facades.
- **Soft deletes & recovery** – restore translations automatically when you rewrite missing content.
- **Caching adapters** – per-model cache, plus pluggable stores (array, Redis, etc.) with auto-invalidation.
- **Pluralisation & fallbacks** – Laravel-style choice syntax and configurable fallback chains.
- **Import/export tooling** – JSON pipelines for collaborating with translators or external services.
- **Audit insights** – Artisan command to surface missing locales and coverage metrics.
